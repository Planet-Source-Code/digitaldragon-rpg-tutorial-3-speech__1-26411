0000=Well,i wont disturb you then.
0007=What did you say your name was?
<0019>
Yeah it is,my creator thinks that this is allot better then comments because many people download the code and dont look at it just run it and forget it,sad but its how it is,I would appriciate if you would vote at PSCode.com.
0009=Yeah i will,let me ask you something else.
<0020>
The character can move a fixed number of pixels per second,so every time the program divides current position + how much the character can move by 1000.So every time it checks will thestep furher be a diferent tile,very simple!
0009=Ok let me ask you something else.
<0021>
Trough DirectDraw.
0009=Ok let me ask you something else.
<0022>
Check the 'IsCursorOverNPC' function,it detects the position and calculates it trought the scroll bar values.
0009=Ok let me ask you something else.
<0023>
In the map file it is specified what to say first and what to say if you have already talked to the character.
0009=Ok let me ask you something else.
<0024>
It is all loaded in the map file,check the map file with notepad and check the clsMap.cls
0009=Ok let me ask you something else.
<0025>
The Redirect tag is 0.
0009=Ok let me ask you something else.
<0026>
He doesnt do anything,he just insults people.
0000=Hmm,let me go talk to him,bye.
